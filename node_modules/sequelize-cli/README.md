## Local Install Usage

```
$ node_modules/.bin/sequelize [--HARMONY-FLAGS]
```

## Options

The manuals will show all the flags and options which are available for the respective tasks.
If you find yourself in a situation where you always define certain flags in order to
make the CLI compliant to your project, you can move those definitions also into a file called
`.sequelizerc`. The file will get `require`d if available and can therefore be either a JSON file
or a Node.JS script that exports a hash.

### Example for a Node.JS script

```javascript
var path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  'config':          path.resolve('config', 'database.json'),
  'migrations-path': path.resolve('db', 'migrate')
}
```

This will configure the CLI to always treat `config/database.json` as config file and
`db/migrate` as the directory for migrations.

### CoffeeScript support

The CLI is compatible with CoffeeScript. You can tell the CLI to enable that support via the `--coffee`
flag. Please note that you'll need to install `js2coffee` and `coffee-script` for full support.

### Configuration file

By default the CLI will try to use the file `config/config.json`. You can modify that path either via
the `--config` flag or via the option mentioned earlier. Here is how a configuration file might look
like (that's is the one that `sequelize init` generates:

```json
{
  "development": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_development",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  },
  "test": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_test",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  },
  "production": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_production",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  }
}
```

### Schema migration

Since v1.0.0 the CLI supports a new schema for saving the executed migrations. It will tell you about that
when you run a migration while having the old schema. You can opt-in for auto migrating the schema by adding a special property to your config file:

```json
{
  "development": {
    "autoMigrateOldSchema": true
  }
}
```
